# 2019-20 NBA Power Rankings

## [H]ere are my tentative rankings for the upcoming NBA season.  It's an exciting new year and there will surely be some big changes.

_Without further ado, here's my top 10_

1. Los Angeles Clippers
2. Houston Rockets
3. Los Angeles Lakers
4. Philadelphia 76'ers
5. Miliuwakee Bucks
6. Denver Nuggets
7. Golden State Warriors
8. Utah Jazz
9. Portland Trail Blazers
10. New Orleans Pelicans

A personal disclosure:

> As a Portlander, I am high on the Blazers this year, but I just don't think they have enough talent or depth to make a real run at the finals this year.
